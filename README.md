## About

This project was born from a shared love for retro gaming and a desire to challenge ourselves with complex game development techniques. The idea was sparked during a late-night discussion about our favorite childhood games and the desire to recreate that nostalgic feeling in a modern context.

As a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, this project has been an opportunity for us to showcase our skills and creativity in game development. It has been a journey of learning, collaboration, and problem-solving, and we are proud to present the result of our hard work.
